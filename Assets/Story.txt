Grandpa said he can protect me, he has his walking stick.
Mama said yes, but she not happy. Tonight grandpa took me outside, my first time outside.

Grandpa made those strange people go away. Grandpa is so cool.
Now grandpa sometimes take me outside, but only outside my house, grandpa said he likes the 'sandbag', he's so funny.
